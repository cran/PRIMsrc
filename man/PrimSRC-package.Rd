\title{Bump Hunting by Patient Rule Induction Method in Survival, Regression and Classification settings}

\description{
    Performs a unified treatment of Bump Hunting by Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) in Survival, Regression and Classification settings (SRC). 
    The method generates decision rules delineating a region in the predictor space, where the response is larger than its average over the entire space. 
    The region is shaped as a hyperdimensional box or hyperrectangle that is not necessarily contiguous. Assumptions are that the multivariate input 
    variables can be discrete or continuous and the univariate response variable can be discrete (Classification), continuous (Regression) 
    or a time-to event, possibly censored (Survival). It is intended to handle low and high-dimensional multivariate datasets, 
    including the situation where the number of covariates exceeds or dominates that of samples (\eqn{p > n} or \eqn{p \gg n} paradigm).
}

\details{
    The current version is a development release that only implements the case of a survival response.
    At this point, survival bump hunting is also restricted to a directed peeling search of the first box covered by the recursive coverage (outer) loop of our 
    Patient Recursive Survival Peeling (PRSP) algorithm. New features will be added soon as they are available. 
    The main function relies on an internal variable pre-selection procedure before the PRSP algorithm is run. 
    At this point, this is done either by regular Cox-regression or cross-validated regularized Cox-regression.
    
    The following describes only the end-user functions that are needed to run a complete procedure.
    The other internal subroutines are briefly documented in the manual, but are not to be called by the end-user at any time. 
    For computational efficiency, some end-user functions offer a parallelization option that is done by passing a few parameters 
    needed to configure a cluster. This is indicated by an asterisk (* = optionally involving cluster usage). 
    The R functions are categorized as follows:

    \enumerate{

      \item{END-USER FUNCTIONS FOR NEWS, SUMMARY AND PREDICTION} \cr
      \code{\link[PRIMsrc]{PRIMsrc.news}}
      \bold{Display the \pkg{PRIMsrc} Package News}\cr
            Function to display the log file \code{NEWS} of updates of the \pkg{PRIMsrc} package.\cr
            
      \code{\link[PRIMsrc]{summary}}
      \bold{Summary Function}\cr
            S3 generic summary function to display the main parameters of a \code{PRSP} object.\cr
            
      \code{\link[PRIMsrc]{predict}}
      \bold{Predict Function}\cr
            S3 generic predict function to predict the box membership and box vertices 
            on an independent set from a \code{PRSP} object trained by a SBH model.\cr
  
      \item{END-USER SURVIVAL BUMP HUNTING FUNCTION} \cr
      \code{\link[PRIMsrc]{sbh}} (*)
      \bold{Cross-Validated Survival Bump Hunting} \cr
            Main end-user function for fitting a cross-validated Survival Bump Hunting (SBH) model.
            It returns a cross-validated \code{PRSP} object, as generated by our Patient Recursive Survival Peeling or PRSP algorithm.
            The function relies on an internal variable pre-selection procedure before the PRSP algorithm is run. 
            At this point, this is done by regular Cox-regression (from the R package \pkg{survival}) 
            or a cross-validated Elasticnet Regularized Cox-Regression (from the R package \pkg{glmnet}), 
            depending on whether the number of covariates is less (\eqn{p \le n}) or greater (\eqn{p > n}) 
            than the number of samples, respectively. At this point, the main function \code{sbh} performs the search of the \emph{first} box 
            of the recursive coverage (outer) loop of our Patient Recursive Survival Peeling (PRSP) algorithm.
            The \code{PRSP} object contains cross-validated estimates of all the decision-rules of pre-selected covariates 
            and all other statistical quantities of interest at each iteration of the peeling sequence (inner loop of the PRSP algorithm). 
            It enables the display of results graphically of/for model tuning/selection, all peeling trajectories, covariate traces, 
            and survival distributions (see plotting functions below for more details). The function offers a few options such as the 
            type of \eqn{K}-fold cross-validation desired ((replicated)-averaged or-combined), 
            the peeling criterion for peeling the next box, the optimization criterion for model tuning and selection 
            and a few more parameters for the PRSP algorithm. The function takes advantage of the R package \pkg{parallel} 
            for efficient parallel execution. It allows users to create a cluster of workstations on a local and/or remote machine(s), 
            enabling scaling-up to the number of specified CPU cores.\cr

      \item{END-USER PLOTTING FUNCTIONS FOR MODEL VALIDATION AND VISUALIZATION OF RESULTS} \cr
      \code{\link[PRIMsrc]{plot_profile}}
      \bold{Visualization for Model Selection/Validation} \cr
            Function for plotting the cross-validated profiles of a \code{PRSP} object.
            It uses the user's choice of statistics among the Log Hazard Ratio (LHR), Log-Rank Test (LRT) or Concordance Error Rate (CER) 
            as a function of the model tuning parameter, that is, the optimal number of peeling steps of the peeling sequence 
            (inner loop of our PRSP algorithm).\cr
      \code{\link[PRIMsrc]{plot_scatter}}
      \bold{2D Visualization of Data Scatter and Box Vertices} \cr
            Function for plotting the cross-validated box vertices of a \code{PRSP} object.
            Plot the data scatter and cross-validated box vertices in a plane at a given peeling step of the peeling sequence 
            (inner loop of our PRSP algorithm).\cr
      \code{\link[PRIMsrc]{plot_boxtraj}}
      \bold{Visualization of Peeling Trajectories/Profiles} \cr
            Function for plotting the cross-validated peeling trajectories/profiles of a \code{PRSP} object.
            Applies to the user-specified covariates among the pre-selected ones and all other statistical quantities of interest
            at each iteration of the peeling sequence (inner loop of our PRSP algorithm). \cr
      \code{\link[PRIMsrc]{plot_boxtrace}}
      \bold{Visualization of Covariates Traces} \cr
            Function for plotting the cross-validated covariates traces of a \code{PRSP} object.
            Plot the cross-validated modal trace curves of covariate importance and covariate usage of the user-specified 
            covariates among the pre-selected ones at each iteration of the peeling sequence (inner loop of our PRSP algorithm). \cr
      \code{\link[PRIMsrc]{plot_boxkm}}
      \bold{Visualization of Survival Distributions} \cr
            Function for plotting the cross-validated survival distributions of a \code{PRSP} object. 
            Plot the cross-validated Kaplan-Meir estimates of survival distributions for the highest risk (inbox) versus
            lower-risk (outbox) groups of samples at each iteration of the peeling sequence (inner loop of our PRSP algorithm). \cr

      \bold{Five Simulated Survival Models Datasets} \cr
            Modeling survival models #1-5 with censoring as a regression function of some informative predictors, depending on the model used. 
            In models where non-informative noisy covariates were used, these covariates were not part of the design matrix (models #2-3 and #5). 
            In one example, the signal is limited to a box-shaped region \eqn{R} of the predictor space (model #4). 
            In the last example, the signal is limited to 10\% of the predictors in a \eqn{p > n} situation (model #5).
            Survival time was generated from an exponential model with with rate parameter \eqn{\lambda} (and mean \eqn{\frac{1}{\lambda}})
            according to a Cox-PH model with hazard exp(eta), where eta(.) is the regression function.
            Censoring indicator were generated from a uniform distribution on [0,3] (models #1-4) or [0,2] (model #5).
            In these synthetic examples, all covariates are continuous, i.i.d. from a multivariate uniform distribution on [0,1] (models #1-4)
            or from a multivariate standard normal distribution (model #5).\cr
            
      \code{\link[PRIMsrc]{Real.1}}
      \bold{Clinical Dataset} \cr
            Publicly available dataset from the Women's Interagency HIV cohort Study (WIHS).
            Inclusion criteria of the study were that women at enrolment were (i) alive, (ii) HIV-1 infected, and 
            (iii) free of clinical AIDS symptoms. Women were followed until the first of the following occurred: 
            (i) treatment initiation (HAART), (ii) AIDS diagnosis, (iii) death, or administrative censoring. 
            The studied outcomes were the competing risks "AIDS/Death (before HAART)" and "Treatment Initiation (HAART)".
            However, here, for simplification purposes, only the first of the two competing events (i.e. the time to AIDS/Death), 
            was used in this dataset example. Likewise, the entire study enrolled 1164 women, but only the complete cases were used 
            in this dataset example for simplification. Variables included history of Injection Drug Use ("IDU") at enrollment,
            African American ethnicity ("Race"), age ("Age"), and baseline CD4 count ("CD4"). The question in this dataset example 
            was whether it is possible to achieve a prognostication of patients for AIDS and HAART.\cr
