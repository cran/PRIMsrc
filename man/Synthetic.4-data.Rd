\title{Synthetic Dataset #4: \eqn{p < n} case}

\description{
  Modeling survival model #4 as described in Dazard et al. (2015) with censoring.
  Here, the regression function uses all of the predictors, which are also part of the design matrix. 
  In thiss example, the signal is limited to a box-shaped region R of the predictor space. 
  Survival time was generated from an exponential model with rate parameter \eqn{\lambda} (and mean \eqn{\frac{1}{\lambda}})
  according to a Cox-PH model with hazard exp(eta), where eta(.) is the regression function.
  Censoring indicator were generated from a uniform distribution on [0, 3].
  In this synthetic example, all covariates are continuous, i.i.d. from a multivariate uniform distribution on [0, 1].

\usage{Synthetic.4}

\format{
  Each dataset consists of a \code{numeric} \code{matrix} containing \eqn{n=250} observations (samples) 
  by rows and \eqn{p=5} variables by columns, including the censoring indicator and (censored) time-to-event variables.
  It comes as a compressed Rda data file.
